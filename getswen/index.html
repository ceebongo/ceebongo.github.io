			<div class="copy">Noise cancellation for your browsing. The anti-NEWS.</div>
		<div class="copyTitle"><a id="what">What</a></div>
			<div class="copy">Have you ever wondered how there are so many 'free' sites that bring you the news?</div>
			<div class="copy">How do these sites make money? What is their product?</div>
			<div class="copy">YOU are the Product! </div>
			<div class="copy">Simply go to your favorite news sites, and let the filter do it's thing. If there are articles that make it through the filter, you will see a list of links from that site. When you click on one of those links, you are shown the article, from the site. Clicking on any other link on the site takes you back to the Swen article page.</div>
			<div class="copy">Use the SWEN news filter to only show you what is really important. You can use the slider to control how much or how little news you see. Our algorithm gathers news events every fifteen minutes and ranks them based on global importance. The SWEN filter kicks in on most global news sites, and only shows links to articles that match your filter setting.</div>
		<div class="copyTitle"><a id="why">Why</a></div>
			<div class="copy">The news sucks. It's a constant drumbeat of 'Breaking News' that is neither breaking nor news - it's mostly garbage. Do we really need an endless stream of drivel about inane celebrities or the day to day horse shit that passes for politics?</div>
			<div class="copy">Why do news sites do this? What is the motivation? They have to, because, advertising. They need a constant 'look at this flashy thing' gimmick so you visit the site often. The more you visit, the more ad revenue they make. It is a self enforcing feedback loop for all the players involved. Except, in this game, only you are the loser. The news site is happy to sell you 'news', and the advertiser is happy to sell you whatever junk they are peddling. </div>
			<div class="copy"><a href="https://markmanson.net/why-you-should-quit-the-news">For an eloquent and beautifully reasoned argument, we highly recommend reading this excellent article by Mark Manson.</a></div>
			<div class="copy">Our main focus is legitimate news sites, but we also have switches to block Social Media and Fake News sites. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Dilemma">sites provide</a> <a href="https://researchguides.austincc.edu/c.php?g=612891&p=4258046">no social</a> <a href="https://www.cits.ucsb.edu/fake-news/danger-social">value</a>. </div>
		<div class="copyTitle"><a id="how">How</a></div>
			<div class="copy">Our algorithm gathers news events every fifteen minutes and ranks them based on global importance. We get data on news events and articles from around thousands of news sites around the world. Every 15 minutes, we update our database of news articles, and we only store 7 days worth of articles. Using a consensus-type algorithm, we rank the importance of events. If more news articles are talking about an event, it rises up in the rankings. Recency of articles also increases their rank.</div>
			<div class="copy">NOTE FOR PUBLISHERS. SWEN does NOT visit, crawl, or store content from your site. We do not condone circumvention of any paywalls or other revenue mechanism on your site. Individual users are responsible for purchasing content (if applicable) from your site.</div>
		<div class="copyTitle"><a id="new">New</a></div>
			<div class="copy">Ideas for future enhancements (drop us an email with suggestions)</div> 				
			<div class="copy">Whitelist new sites so SWEN doesn't filter them</div>
			<div class="copy">Blacklist sites as Social Media or Fake News (let us know!)</div> 				
			<div class="copy">Mobile Apps</div> 				
		<div class="copyTitle"><a id="donate">Donate</a></div>
			<div class="copy">We strongly believe in our purpose of trying to eliminate as much noise from the news as possible. BUT. Writing code, running servers, troubleshooting - all cost money. Our hope is that we receive enough in donations to keep this going.</div> 	
			<div class="copy">Thank you for your generous support.</div>
